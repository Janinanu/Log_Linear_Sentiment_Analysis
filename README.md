# Log_Linear_Sentiment_Analysis

This code implements a log-linear model for sentiment analysis and is an extension of my Naive Bayes model.
It is based on a dataset "polarity dataset v2.0" which can be downloaded here: www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data 
The dataset contains tokenized movie reviews which are classified into positive and negative reviews.
